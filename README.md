# Tjree
A tree plugin created with jQuery, Bootstrap UI styled.
jQuery version: 1.11.3
Bootstrap version: 3.3.5

Lots of jQuery tree plugins found everywhere, but none of them meet my need. That's why this plugin says hello world.

Why this tree plugins named 'Tjree':
Because my name is 'Tanj', so 'Tanj'+"Tree'=Tjree. :p

What you can do with this tree plugin:
1. fold/unfold;
2. delete a node, edit a node, add a child, or see more info of the node;
3. drag and drop a node;



so far, this tree plugin just contains these simple functions as above or even hides some bugs, however, hope some ppl like it and help with improving it in future.
